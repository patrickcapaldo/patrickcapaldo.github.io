My dream is to pursue a career at the forefront of space exploration, aerospace engineering, and autonomy by contributing to the development of revolutionary design and technology. As a Machine Learning Software Engineer at Airbus, I am working towards this dream. All of my opinions are my own and not that of my employer.
