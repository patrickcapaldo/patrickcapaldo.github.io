Today's Python Puzzle will test your knowledge of order of execution, operator precedence, and scope.

- Execution Order: Tracking the order of statements and the effect of function calls.
- Operator Precedence: Understanding how `x = x + y` works when `x` is global.
- Variable Scope: Understanding `global`, `nonlocal`, and local scopes.

Read each line carefully and try to predict the output.

Feel free to use an online Python compiler and interpreter like [this] (https://www.online-python.com/) to try running the code yourself. The answer is supplied below the code.

```python
# Python Execution Puzzle!
# Can you predict the output of this code?

x = 5

def puzzle():
    global x
    y = 10
    x = x + y

    def inner():
        nonlocal y
        y = 20
        print("Inside inner:", x, y)

    inner()
    print("Inside puzzle:", x, y)

puzzle()
print("Outside puzzle:", x)

```

## Answer

After `puzzle()` runs:

1. `x` in the global scope is updated to `15` (from `x + y = 5 + 10`).
2. `inner()` modifies `y` in `puzzle()` to `20`.
3. The `print()` inside `inner()` outputs `Inside inner: 15 20`.
4. The `print()` inside `puzzle()` outputs `Inside puzzle: 15 20`.
5. Finally, `print("Outside puzzle:", x)` outputs `Outside puzzle: 15`.

Expected output:

```
Inside inner: 15 20
Inside puzzle: 15 20
Outside puzzle: 15
```
