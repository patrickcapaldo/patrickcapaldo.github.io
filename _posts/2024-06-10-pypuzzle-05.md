This puzzle explores how Python handles "private" variables using **name mangling**, a mechanism that modifies variable names to avoid accidental access or override in subclasses.

## Topics Covered
- Name mangling  
- Private variables in classes  
- Attribute access and introspection  

## Puzzle Question
Why does direct access to `__secret` raise an error, and how can it still be accessed? What will the following code print?

## Puzzle Code
```python
class Spy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__secret = "hidden"

    def reveal(self):
        return self.__secret

agent = Spy()
```

# What will each of these lines do?

```python
print(agent.reveal())
print(agent.__secret)
print(agent._Spy__secret)
```

## Hints

1. Double underscores at the start of a variable name trigger name mangling.
2. Name mangling changes the variable name internally to avoid accidental access in subclasses.
3. It’s still possible to access the variable — if you know the mangled name.

## Answer

```bash
hidden
AttributeError
hidden
```

## Explanation

- `agent.reveal()` works because it accesses `__secret` from within the class where it was defined.
- `agent.__secret` raises an `AttributeError` because the name has been mangled to `_Spy__secret`.
- `agent._Spy__secret` works because it manually accesses the mangled name.

## Learnings

- Name Mangling: Python uses name mangling to help protect class internals from accidental overwrites or clashes, especially in subclasses.
- Not Truly Private: Python doesn’t have true private variables — name mangling is only a convention-based safeguard.
- Debugging & Introspection: Understanding name mangling is important when debugging, using `dir()`, or reflecting on class attributes.
