What are the pros and cons of using a GPS to navigate? Or a calculator to do simple arithmetic?

Conversely, what are the pros and cons of growing your own food? Or doing all your research only via books in a library?

These are all examples of paths of resistance.

In our current era, exploiting the ease of using GPS or calculators is an example of taking a path of low resistance. There is nothing inherently wrong with this. Using a GPS will probably get you to your destination faster and using a calculator will probably help you to finish your work quicker, meaning you can spend more time doing what you like or spending time with your friends and family. However, the more parts of our lives we automate, the more skills we lose. If you only use GPS, you may lose your spatial awareness and navigation skills completely. If you only use calculators, you might not be able to tally-up prices or check if a discount is worth it when shopping. There is a cost to taking the path of low resistance.

Conversely, in our current era, only eating what one grows or refusing to use the internet for research are examples of paths of high resistance. Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with this. Growing your own food will likely lead you to improved health and gaining important skills and knowledge about our natural world and self-sustainability. Additionally, if you only used physical books to do your research, you might read things that can't be found on the internet, be led down rabbit holes that only the meanderings through physical aisles could cause, or even meet someone who helps you more than the internet ever would. However, the more parts of our lives we do manually, the less time we have to do other things. If you only eat food you grow, you will be limited nutritionally by your environment and you sustenance will be subject to the whims of the weather. Additionally, if you only do research via books in a library, you will miss out on billions of other sources and perspectives that no collection of books could possibly provide, let alone for you to comb through if it did exist. There is a cost to taking the path of high resistance.

By now we can see that neither path, low nor high resistance, is 'best'. Both have pros and cons. So, maybe the 'best' path is somewhere in-between - or maybe its to walk all of them, but not one for too long.

This is also true of our world now that we have machine learning models approaching the capabilities of human intelligence. What does it mean for us to outsource critical thinking tasks? What is the purpose of a human if they simply prompt a machine learning model? Sure, we have taste and our direction and guidance is worth a lot. But at what point do we then outsource the taste and direction, since surely a path of even less resistance would be asking the machine learning model "give me some ideas yourself", and we select from there.

The path of least resistance is a nice one, but it gets slippery pretty fast.

If you don't stop and reflect every now and then, sometimes forcing yourself to take a path of higher resistance, what will you become? As I mentioned, there is nothing wrong with any of these paths. Take this article as an example, I wrote it off the top of my mind and with my own thoughts, yet utilised AI to generate the cover photo and am publishing it on the internet using my computer. 

As I said, maybe the 'best' path is all of them, but not one for too long.
