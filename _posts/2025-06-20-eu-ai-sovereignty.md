## Before You Read

**Who Should Read:** Engineers, strategists and decision-makers involved in AI deployment, data‑centre planning, and supply‑chain strategy in Europe. A basic familiarity with AI hardware ecosystems and European digital‑sovereignty debates is assumed.

**What You’ll Learn:**
- The meaning of the “Sovereign AI” concept as advanced by Nvidia and how it aligns with European digital‑sovereignty goals.
- The key partnerships and investment announcements made during Jensen Huang’s recent European tour.
- How these developments could reshape data‑centre planning, chip procurement, and supply‑chain decisions in Europe.
- Immediate strategic steps for organisations and policymakers operating in Europe’s AI infrastructure domain.

## Europe’s AI Crossroads

Europe’s leaders have for years voiced concerns that the continent trails the United States and China in AI infrastructure. Data‑centre capacity, chip availability and domestic cloud offerings have lagged behind global hyperscalers. High energy costs and regulatory hurdles for new data centres add to the complexity. Against this backdrop, the idea of “digital sovereignty” - the notion that Europe should reduce dependency on non‑European tech giants for critical infrastructure - has grown from policy rhetoric into tangible action plans. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang has seen this opportunity and gone for it with his European tour in June 2025.

## Defining “Sovereign AI”

The term “Sovereign AI” as presented by Huang is anchored in the belief that AI models, data and inference workloads should reflect local languages, cultures and regulatory requirements. He argues that “each nation needs to develop and own its AI” so that solutions are tailored to regional needs rather than imposed from afar [1]. This framing resonates with longstanding EU policy themes: data‑protection rules, strategic autonomy and support for domestic industry.

According to Reuters, Huang has been pitching this concept since 2023, but in mid‑2025 it gained traction as European leaders responded to concrete proposals rather than abstract exhortations. Financial Times coverage echoed this, noting Huang’s warning that Europe must “move into AI quickly” or risk remaining solely a consumer of foreign technologies [2]. Thus, “Sovereign AI” became more than just a slogan: it serves as a clear geopolitical message for the importance of AI in the near future, and of course, as a powerful sales pitch for Nvidia.

## London: An Invitation to Whitehall

</div>

In early June 2025, the UK government, having recently signalled ambitions to bolster national AI capabilities, invited Huang to London Tech Week. At a roundtable in Whitehall, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasised the desire for Britain to become “an AI maker and not an AI taker”. Shortly afterwards, he announced a £1 billion package to scale up computing power for domestic AI research and development [2][3].

Nvidia’s presence in this narrative was immediate. In meetings with UK officials and domestic cloud and telecom providers, Huang outlined how Nvidia’s AI accelerators and software stacks could underpin in‑region compute platforms. The message was clear: while Europe seeks sovereignty, it will still rely on technology from leading vendors. This paradox, that digital independence may deepen ties with dominant suppliers, surfaced repeatedly in conversations and press coverage.

## Paris: VivaTech and the Sovereignty Narrative

</div>

A few days later in Paris at VivaTech, the narrative deepened. On the conference stage, French President Emmanuel Macron declared that building AI infrastructure was “our fight for sovereignty” [1]. Beside him on the panel sat Huang and the CEO of Mistral, a fast‑growing French AI startup. Mistral announced a partnership with Nvidia to build a data centre powered by Nvidia AI chips, starting with 18,000 units in the first phase and with plans for multi‑site expansion in 2026 [1][4]. This collaboration was depicted as a template for how European model builders and infrastructure providers could join forces with leading hardware suppliers to create a region‑focused AI ecosystem.

In a separate press statement, Nvidia detailed agreements with model builders and cloud providers across France, Italy, Spain and beyond, aiming to deploy Nvidia Nemotron‑optimised models via regional AI infrastructure [4]. Nvidia Nemotron is a family of open, large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) designed to accelerate the development of AI agents, especially in enterprise settings. The emphasis was on local data handling, compliance with EU regulations and reduced latency for European end users. This narrative wove policy and technology: Europe’s digital‑sovereignty ambitions meet Nvidia’s hardware roadmap, anchored by the promise of tailored AI services.

## Berlin: An Industrial AI Cloud

</div>

Continuing the tour, Huang travelled to Berlin to meet Chancellor Friedrich Merz and engage with German telecom giant Deutsche Telekom. According to Reuters, the discussion revolved around building an “industrial AI cloud” in Germany that will use Nvidia technology [1][5]. Merz characterised this as vital for Germany’s economic future and digital sovereignty. Germany, a leading EU economy with a world-class industrial sector, views AI as central to competitiveness.

In that context, Nvidia’s proposal to work with Deutsche Telekom on an in‑region cloud platform offered a way to keep sensitive industrial data within Europe while accessing state‑of‑the‑art accelerators. Yet, the conversation also highlighted challenges: data centres consume significant electricity, and Europe’s energy costs are higher than many other regions. Reports note that data centres account for about 3 per cent of EU electricity demand and face scrutiny over sustainability and grid impact as AI workloads surge [1][6]. Thus, while the promise of a sovereign AI cloud is appealing, it introduces new energy and regulatory considerations.

## Underlying Policy Moves: EU Action Plans and Gigafactories

Behind the scenes, the European Commission has been consulting on AI infrastructure roadmaps. In early 2025, Brussels floated plans for multiple “AI gigafactories” with an estimated combined budget of US$20 billion to develop local chip production, packaging and advanced data‑centre capabilities [1]. Additionally, the European Commission approved a €1.5 billion fund in December last year for seven new or upgraded AI supercomputers of which the first are planned to be launched this year [10]. Although full semiconductor fabrication remains concentrated in a few global sites (most famously, TSMC in Taiwan), the EU seeks to bolster assembly, packaging and specialised AI component production within Europe.

Nvidia reportedly discussed allocating some chip production capacity to Europe for these projects, indicating a willingness to support EU objectives [1]. These plans were further detailed in a European Commission press release for the AI Continent Action Plan [11] that highlights 13 AI Factories, including LUMI AIF in Finland, MIMER in Sweden, PIAST AIF in Poland, AIF Austria, BRAIN++ in Bulgaria, Pharos in Greece, SLAIF in Slovenia, ITALIA in Italy, JAIF and HammerHAI in Germany, AIZF in France, BSC AIF in Spain, and Meluxina-AI in Luxembourg. The EuroHPC initiative provides the raw hardware and infrastructure layer for the AI Factories (AIF) which are the application layer responsible for deploying and maintaining AI services.

National governments have likewise introduced incentives: beyond the UK’s £1 billion compute fund, Germany and France are updating policies to ease data‑centre planning while emphasising renewable energy partnerships. Yet challenges remain: planning approval timelines can be long; high energy prices and grid constraints require innovative approaches such as co‑location with renewable projects or off‑peak operation models. These policy signals form the backdrop to Nvidia’s tour and the partnerships unveiled.

## Industry Response: European Cloud and Telecom Providers

</div>

Across Europe, regional cloud and telecom providers are preparing to roll out Nvidia‑powered AI services. In the UK, firms such as Nebius and Nscale announced plans to integrate thousands of Nvidia GPUs into their data centres, positioning themselves as sovereign‑friendly alternatives to global hyperscalers [4]. In France and Germany, similar announcements emerged: collaborations between Nvidia and local operators to offer AI platforms tailored to European compliance requirements.

Start-ups and system integrators also reacted. Mistral’s alliance with Nvidia exemplifies how local model builders can leverage global hardware leadership while retaining data‑governance controls. Other European AI startups are exploring hybrid approaches: combining open models, local data pipelines and hardware co‑investment through public‑private partnerships. However, domain observers caution, reasonably, that Europe’s smaller domestic budgets cannot match the quarterly infrastructure spending of US hyperscalers, which can exceed US$10 billion per quarter on data‑centre expansion [1]. This gap underscores the need for creative consortium-based funding, efficiency improvements in hardware usage, and prioritisation of strategic use cases.

## What This Means for Compute Supply Chains

Despite the aim of sovereignty, Nvidia emerges as a central figure, as they often do when AI hardware becomes a topic of expenditure. Europe seeks independence but still relies on a leading non‑European hardware vendor. This duality scores a line in the sand for Europe’s AI capabilities - they are confident they can replicate the businesses of the model designers and manufacturers, but not those of the hardware designers and manufacturers like Nvidia and TSMC, respectively. This is a reasonable decision as catching-up to Nvidia is something that no company on the planet has been able to achieve yet (let alone catching up to TSMC), so this goal is likely on a further horizon.

This entrenchment also suggests Nvidia’s market position will strengthen, as regional cloud operators and government-backed projects procure Blackwell GPUs and associated software stacks. Supply‑chain planners should anticipate high demand for Nvidia components, potential lead times for GPUs and related infrastructure (power supplies, interconnects). Organisations must plan procurement cycles early and consider potential shortages.

### Potential for Local Assembly and Packaging
The EU’s gigafactory proposals and Nvidia’s indication of allocating some production to Europe may open avenues for local assembly, packaging or specialised chip variants tailored to European needs. While wafer fabrication likely remains offshore, assembly and testing in Europe could reduce some supply‑chain risks (e.g., geopolitical tensions affecting shipping). Stakeholders should monitor announcements from EU semiconductor alliances and Nvidia’s manufacturing roadmap for possible engagement opportunities.

### Energy and Infrastructure Constraints
AI workloads are notoriously energy‑intensive. Europe’s higher electricity costs and stricter environmental regulations mean data‑centre operators must develop sustainable approaches. This could include partnerships with renewable energy providers, deployment of energy‑efficient GPU clusters and exploring liquid cooling or specialised facility designs. Supply‑chain considerations extend to securing reliable renewable energy contracts, hardware configurations optimised for power efficiency, and planning for grid integration challenges.

### Strategic Leverage and Public‑Private Collaboration
Governments may offer funding or incentives tied to digital‑sovereignty objectives. Organisations should engage early in public‑private forums and consultations to influence funding criteria, understand compliance requirements and position proposals for co‑investment. Being part of industry alliances or forums can yield insights into forthcoming tenders or policy shifts. For hardware vendors and cloud providers, aligning offerings with sovereignty criteria (e.g., data residency guarantees, local support) can enhance their appeal and competitiveness.

## Immediate Steps for Strategists in Europe
Identify Current Dependencies
Start by auditing existing compute infrastructure and supplier relationships. Find workloads with strict data‑residency or compliance demands that would benefit from in‑region deployment (e.g., highly sensitive or confidential data or processes). This identification informs where to invest in sovereign‑aligned infrastructure versus where to continue using established global hyperscalers for less sensitive tasks.

### Engage in Sovereign AI Forums
Join relevant working groups or industry forums (e.g., the newly formed UK Sovereign AI Industry Forum [12], EU consultations). Early engagement yields awareness of funding streams, regulatory expectations and partnership opportunities. It also provides a platform to raise practical concerns (e.g., energy costs, talent gaps).

### Assess Hybrid Infrastructure Models
Evaluate a hybrid approach combining in‑region data centres with Nvidia hardware for sensitive or strategic workloads, and external clouds for elasticity. Analyse cost‑benefit trade‑offs, factoring in total cost of ownership (including energy, real estate and talent) and performance requirements.

### Plan for Sustainable Energy
Collaborate with renewable energy providers or explore on‑site generation where feasible. Work with hardware architects to design energy‑efficient clusters (e.g., right‑sized GPU pods, advanced cooling). Incorporate energy cost projections into financial models for new data‑centre builds or expansions. Ensure a clear understanding of the electricity requirements of AI workloads is understood and how different energy sources provide this electricity (e.g., the benefit of batteries when utilising pure renewable energy).

### Monitor Nvidia and Competitor Roadmaps
Keep abreast of Nvidia announcements regarding hardware availability, local production or assembly initiatives, and software stacks (e.g., Nvidia AI Cloud). Equally, watch for emerging European or global competitors offering alternative accelerators or open‑source hardware initiatives that could diversify supply‑chain risk.

### Develop Talent and Ecosystem
Invest in training programmes for AI infrastructure management and MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) aligned with sovereign‑AI objectives. Partner with universities, accelerator programmes and Nvidia’s training offerings to build a skilled workforce capable of deploying and optimising in‑region AI systems.

### Prepare for Regulatory and Planning Timelines
Data‑centre projects can face lengthy planning approvals. Begin early discussions with local authorities on zoning, environmental assessments and permitting. Align project timelines with anticipated grant or subsidy windows to avoid delays.

### Prototype Strategic Use Cases
Identify high‑value AI applications (e.g., industrial automation in Germany, healthcare analytics in France, financial services in the UK) that justify sovereign‑aligned infrastructure. Pilot projects can demonstrate viability, attract further funding and build momentum for larger-scale deployment.

## Conclusion
Jensen Huang’s mid-June 2025 European tour is a story of two tales: Europe wants AI sovereignty, and Nvidia wants to give it to them. The slight irony here being that Nvidia is not a European company, yet this does push the envelope of European AI capability further out from where it currently is by ensuring Europe at least creates and runs its own models. Full sovereignty of the AI stack (i.e., including chip design and manufacture) is something that will take much longer to achieve, yet baby-steps like assembly and testing of chips are tasks that could be introduced now to work towards this.

Jensen’s tour destinations, in London, Paris and Berlin, revealed concrete partnerships, government funding commitments and discussions about local assembly, all situated within broader EU policy moves like AI gigafactories. For supply‑chain strategists, the imperative is clear: plan proactively for high demand for Nvidia hardware, engage in public‑private collaborations, address energy and regulatory constraints, and develop hybrid infrastructure models. By meshing together these trends, organisations can help Europe’s aspiration to be an “AI maker” rather than an “AI taker,” while managing practical challenges around cost, sustainability and supply‑chain resilience.
