# Motivation

Exploronomics provides an intuitive and visually engaging way to explore the economics of countries around the world. Users can interact with a 3D globe, click on countries to learn more about them, and view key information displayed dynamically in a user-friendly modal window.

I have a strong interest in learning about why countries are the way they are, and economics plays a very important role in this as it sets the playing field for society. Therefore, it sets the rules for how people live their lives.
