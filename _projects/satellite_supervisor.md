# Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the application of machine learning algorithms in predicting the purpose of satellites based on a limited set of features. The prediction model aims to classify the purpose of a satellite into predefined categories using the provided data.

# Features

- Limited Information: Predictions are made using only a subset of features available for each satellite.
- Machine Learning: Various machine learning algorithms are explored and evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting satellite purposes.
- Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing techniques are applied to prepare the input data for model training.
- Model Evaluation: The performance of different models is evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their accuracy and reliability.
